What's the personality of AfD-Voters?

A large-scale Bayes multi-level modeling study on the effect of personality and regional factors on voting the AfD



The party "Alternative fuer Deutschland" (AfD) is a right-wing to far-right political party in Germany.
Founded in 2013, it that has managed to gain seats in all states parliaments as well as in the federal parliament within a short period of time. 
The AfD became the third-largest party in Germany after the 2017 federal elections.
Such striking success is quite unique in German post-war politics.
Consequently, AfDâ€™s upsurge has sparked an intensive debate as to the whys and hows of this success. 
Although a variety of putative causes have been put forward, with a focus on socioeconomic factors,
the underpinning pathways of voters' decision in favor of the AfD remain largely unknown.
This study is novel insofar it investigates the potential influence of personality, 
using the Big Five system, on AfD voting; 
socioeconomic factors are included as well. 
In addition, we build on a large sample of a total of 73,756 individuals and employ employ a rigorous Bayesian multi-level modeling approach. 
In sum, results show some influence of voters' personality on their propensity to vote for the AfD. 
Interestingly, regional influences appear to exert an stronger influence even when socioeconomic factors are taken into account. 
As such, this research sheds new light and provides new avenues for research on voting behavior.
