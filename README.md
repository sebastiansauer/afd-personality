Modeling AfD's ("Alternative fuer Deutschland", political party in Germany) election success in the German federal elections 2017 as a function of personality and socioeconomic factors


In this repo, we report a study that tries to model the voting/election success of the "AfD" ("Alternative fuer Deutschland", political party in Germany) in the German federal elections of 2017.

Voting success is modelled as a function of the Big Five personality system and some socioeconomic factors.

We use linear models in different variants to analyse our theoretical model.
